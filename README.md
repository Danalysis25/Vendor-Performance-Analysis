# ðŸ“Š Data Analytics Project â€“ Vendor Performance & Inventory Optimization  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance, profitability, and inventory efficiency using a *data-driven approach*.  
The workflow integrates *SQL (ETL & Data Modeling), **Python (EDA & Hypothesis Testing), and **Power BI (Data Visualization)* to uncover actionable business insights.  

---

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights  
- *Developed & Optimized SQL ETL Pipeline*  
  - Built an *aggregated summary table* from multiple source tables.  
  - Optimized queries using *CTEs & data filtering* â†’ significantly reduced processing time for large datasets.  

- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Hypothesis Testing in Python*  
  - Evaluated *vendor profitability, **pricing strategy effectiveness, and **inventory turnover*.  
  - Identified:  
    - âš  *Over-dependence* on top 10 vendors â†’ *65.7% of purchases*.  
    - ðŸ“¦ *$2.71M unsold inventory* from low-performing vendors.  
  - Suggested *vendor diversification & inventory optimization*.  

- *Interactive Power BI Dashboards*  
  - Visualized:  
    - ðŸ“ˆ Vendor performance & profit margins  
    - ðŸ“‰ Bulk purchasing impact (*72% cost reduction*)  
    - ðŸ“¦ Inventory turnover & stock health  
  - Provided *executive-level insights* for decision-makers.

# ðŸ“Š Business Insights & Outcomes

Reduced ETL processing time with optimized SQL queries.

Identified vendor risk concentration (65.7% dependency).

Uncovered $2.71M of unsold inventory, leading to inventory optimization strategies.

Enabled cost savings of 72% via bulk purchasing analysis.

Delivered interactive dashboards for faster decision-making.









# ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

Automate ETL pipeline scheduling with Airflow / Prefect.

Integrate real-time vendor performance tracking.

Expand analysis with predictive modeling (ML) for inventory forecasting.
